					<li class = "fragment fadein">Previous mail apps I used, <span class ="fragment fadein">and why they ended up making me really sad</span></li><br />
					<li class = "fragment fadein">Why CloudMagic was worth the $20,<span class ="fragment fadein"> even when there are some things that need some work</span></li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Personal requirements for email clients:</h2><br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Had to support all three of my email accounts, across Gmail and Yahoo!</li><br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Setup and sync without much fuss</li> <br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">UI needed to not make my eyes bleed</li>

					<h1>Desktop Clients</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Desktop Client I used to love but then it got really, really sick: Inky</h2>
					<img src ="images/Inky.png">
					<p><span class ="fragment fadein">Known for:</span> <span class ="fragment fadein">categorizing all of your emails under "Smart Views" and listed everything based on importance to you</p></span>
				</section>

				<section> <p>It looked like this when I last used it, only the Smart View icons were bigger:</p>
					<img src="images/Inky-message-1.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What I loved about this app:</h2>
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Automatically found tracking information for shipments across all emails<span class ="fragment fadein"> -> </span><span class ="fragment fadein">collected it all under the Packages Smart View for real-time tracking, yay! â™¡</li></span><br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Gave you the option to disable images in emails</li><br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">One-click Subscription Management: <span class ="fragment fadein"> Unsubscribe from all the things!</li></span><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">One of the few that supported IMAP for my Yahoo! accounts without having to pay! <span class ="fragment fadein">(yes, this was quite some time ago!)</li></span>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Things that sounded cool in theory, but were actually kinda "meh"</h2><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Inky's default view would list items depending on importance</span>
					</li>
					<li class="fragment fadein">You can change whether or not something is relevant to you by clicking on the ink blot icon</li>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>But what happened?!</h2>
				<H3>Inky just stopped working for me:</h3>
					<li span class="fragment fadein">Started to miss some shipments in the Packages Smart View</li><br />
					<li span class="fragment fadein">Inky kept having to resync aaaaall of my email,<span class="fragment fadein"> from the dawn of time,</span> <span class="fragment fadein">and then, after all of that waiting, it would crash!</span></li><br />
					<li span class="fragment fadein">My lamentations were ignored by Inky's support team</li>
				</section>

					<h2>We Have A New Challenger!</h2> <h3 class="fragment fadein">(sort of)</span></h3>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Airmail</h2>
					<img src ="images/airmail_mac_screen.jpeg">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What was good about it?</h2>
					<li class ="fragment fadein">It mostly worked</li><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Didn't try to destroy my email archives when trying to sync, like Mail tried to!</li><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Had a good-looking UI</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What was bad about it?</h2>
					<li class ="fragment fadein">It was slooo<span class ="fragment fadein">oooooo</span><span class="fragment fadein">oowwwwww</span></li><br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">It kept setting off my Sophos Anti-Virus when I was not in danger</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>In Summary</h2>
					<p>The desktop clients I tried were not very good at the basic functionality of viewing my emails in a timely fashion.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h1>Moving on <span class="fragment fadein"> -> </span><span class ="fragment fadein">Mobile Clients</span></h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Summary of common problems with mobile email clients</h2><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Sync/push notification delays -> having to manually resync/check email for app to update</li><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Unwieldy setup</li><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Ads</li><br />
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Boxer</h2><br />
					<img src ="images/Boxer-app-iPhone.jpeg">
					<p>Probably best known for its extensibility with other applications and swiping gestures</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Best parts of the app for me</h2>
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Avatars shown to the left of messages <span class ="fragment fadein">-></span> <span class="fragment fadein">helped to more immediately discern where emails were coming from, <span class = "fragment fadein">differentiating messages</li></span><br />
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Swiping gestures on lock screen <span class ="fragment fadein">-></span> <span class="fragment fadein">allowed an immediate means to do things such as mark something as read or to open the email in question</li></span>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Things I didn't like</h2>
					<li class="fragment fadein">Personally found myself completing the wrong actions via swiping <span class="fragment fadein">-></span> <span class="fragment fadein">no matter which way I would set the gestures, my brain would fart at some point and I would archive something I meant to mark as spam</li></span><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Emails not getting sent to recipients, no matter how many times I retried</li><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Bug: If I exited and re-entered the app while editing a draft, I found that after sending out the finished email, I would later find multiple instances of that email in the reply history</li>

				<h2>CloudMagic</h2>

				<section>
					<p>I can finally have a consistent experience across all of my devices!! AND EVERYTHING LOADS SO QUICK OMGGGGGGG</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Things I specifically love</h2>
					<li class ="fragment fadein">Practically instantenous populating of my emails, and search doesn't have to take forever to find something more obscure</li>
					<li class="fragment fadein">I can share via email random articles and stuff from the interwebz again! (usually only Mail can do this from the mobile browser!)</li>
					<li class="fragment fadein">I can make a new item on Todoist or save something on my Pocket account via Cards!</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Things that could use some improvement</h2>
					<li class="fragment fadein">On mobile <span class ="fragment fadein">-></span> <span class="fragment fadein">By default, CloudMagic saves all attachments, noooo!</li></span> <br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">On desktop <span class="fragment fadein">-></span> <span class ="fragment fadein">A way to customize the notification sound would be nice</li></span><br />
					<li class="fragment fadein">Better spam management</li>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>In closing</h2>
					<p>In the future, I'm sure the app might have an app-breaking bug or suddenly lose all support, but for now I'm just happy to have just one email client that I can log into across all my devices, and all the important things that need to work actually, in fact, do!</p>
